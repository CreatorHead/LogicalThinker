	when he wants to compose a song he picks nodes from his book and place in the sequence
	
	Ex : he picks 5 (AS NODE NUMBER) nodes ==> X, B, AX, AD and MD
	and he take a random number and starts playing, 
	lets say 
	1. if he takes random number 10 (SONG NUMBER), the the song will be X, B, AX, AD, MD, X, B, AX, AD, MD
	2. if he takes random number 4(SONG NUMBER), the the song will be X, B, AX, AD
	3. if he takes random number 2(SONG NUMBER), the the song will be X, B
	
	Note creating the nodes will be left to the director he may create as many nodes he want and he may 
	choose any number as NODE NUMBER and any number as SONG NUMBER.
	
	Write a java code or android app for this. There should be the use of different class for Nodes.
	and the input for nodes , node number and song number will be given dynamically by music player.
